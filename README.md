# Predictive Insights: Anticipating Customer Order Dates for Strategic Decision Making

Predicting customer order dates is a game-changer for businesses seeking to stay ahead in today's dynamic market. By leveraging predictive analytics, companies gain invaluable insights into customer behavior, allowing them to anticipate when purchases will occur. This foresight enables businesses to optimize inventory levels, streamline production schedules, and allocate resources more effectively. Moreover, forecasting order dates empowers companies to tailor marketing campaigns precisely, ensuring targeted outreach at the most opportune moments. As a result, businesses can enhance customer satisfaction, boost sales, and drive long-term growth. With data-driven decisions fueled by accurate predictions, companies can navigate the competitive landscape with confidence and precision, securing their position as industry leaders.By leveraging advanced analytics, businesses can proactively address customer demands, minimize stockouts, maximize sales opportunities, and ultimately drive revenue growth in a competitive marketplace.

This project aims to predict customer order dates by employing various classification methods to determine whether a customer will place an order on a specific date. By assessing classification accuracy, the most effective method is identified and applied to forecast future order dates for all customers. This predictive capability empowers businesses with data-driven insights, enabling them to anticipate customer behavior, optimize inventory management, plan marketing campaigns effectively, and enhance overall operational efficiency.

**Data Extraction and Preprocessing:**
The project begins by connecting to a SQL Server database using the **pyodbc** library. 
Relevant sales order data is extracted from the database tables using SQL queries.
Extracted data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Data preprocessing steps include converting data types, filtering out irrelevant records, and creating new features such as year, month, and day of the order.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Exploratory data analysis is performed on the processed data to gain insights into the sales order patterns.
Visualizations are created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to illustrate the order frequency over time.

**Customer Segmentation:**
Customer segmentation is not explicitly performed in this project, but we have made another project to segment customers through RFM analysis.

**Model Training and Evaluation:**
Various Machine learning models are trained to predict customer order status.
Various classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and K-Nearest Neighbour are trained and evaluated for their performance.
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC are computed for each model.

**Future Predictions:**
Future predictions for customer order status are made using the trained XGBoost model.
Predictions are generated for a specified future period (30 days from the current date).

This project demonstrates the power of predictive analytics in transforming businesses' decision-making processes. By accurately forecasting customer order dates, companies can unlock opportunities for efficiency, effectiveness, and customer-centricity. Armed with insights from our predictive models, businesses are better equipped to navigate the ever-evolving landscape, driving success and sustainability in the digital age.
